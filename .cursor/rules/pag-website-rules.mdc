Secondary Background: #F7F7F7 for section separation
Text Primary: #000000 for headings and important text

Accent Green: #10B981 for success states and positive metrics
Border Color: #E5E7EB for subtle borders and dividers
Code Background: #F3F4F6 for code blocks and technical elements
Always ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

Typography Rules

Use Inter font family exclusively
Implement the exact font sizes specified in the design system
